# Date and Time Server Example

This example demonstrates a simple client-server application where the server sends the current date and time to the client upon connection. This is implemented using Python's socket programming. The server listens for incoming connections on a specified port, and when a client connects, it sends the current date and time to the client, which then prints the received information.

## Server

The server script sets up a socket to listen for incoming connections on a specified IP address and port. When a client connects, the server obtains the current date and time, formats it as a string, sends this information to the client, and then closes the connection.

### Setup and Execution

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Save the server code to a file, for example, `server.py`.
3. Run the server script using Python:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

The server will start and print "Server is waiting for client request..." to indicate it is listening for connections.

## Client

The client script establishes a connection to the server using the server's IP address and port. Upon connection, it waits to receive the date and time from the server, prints the received information, and then closes the connection.

### Setup and Execution

1. Ensure the server script is running and listening for connections.
2. Save the client code to a file, for example, `client.py`.
3. Run the client script using Python, ensuring it is configured to connect to the correct server IP and port:

```bash
python3 client.py
```

Upon execution, the client will connect to the server, receive the current date and time, and print it.

## Important Notes

- This example uses localhost (`127.0.0.1`) and port `12345` for demonstration purposes. For actual use, replace these with the server's IP address and port.
- The code is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates basic socket communication in Python. It lacks error handling, authentication, or encryption, which are necessary for production environments.
- Ensure your network configurations allow for the intended connections and that proper security measures are in place when deploying applications that use network communication.

This example provides a foundational understanding of how client-server communication works in Python, specifically for transmitting simple data like the current date and time. It can be expanded to include more complex interactions, multiple client handling, and secure data transmission.
