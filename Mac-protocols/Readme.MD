# Simple CSMA/CA Simulation in Python

This repository contains a Python script that simulates the basic behavior of the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. CSMA/CA is a network protocol used primarily in wireless networks to avoid data collisions by implementing a method for an electronic device to check if another transmission is currently in progress before starting its own transmission.

## Overview

The CSMA/CA simulation provided here is simplified and intended for educational purposes. It illustrates the basic concepts of checking if the medium (e.g., air for wireless communications) is idle, waiting for a random backoff time if the medium is busy, and attempting to transmit data again.

## Features

- **Medium Check**: Simulates checking if the transmission medium is idle or busy.
- **Random Backoff**: Implements a random backoff mechanism to avoid collision.
- **Data Transmission**: Simulates the data transmission process.
- **Recursive Transmission Attempts**: Tries to transmit data recursively after waiting for the backoff period if the medium was initially busy.

## Prerequisites

Before you run this script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. This script was developed and tested with Python 3.8, but it should work with any version of Python 3.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `python3 csma-ca.py` file to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.
4. Run the script using Python by typing:

5. Follow the console outputs to see how the CSMA/CA simulation behaves.

## Understanding the Code

- The script begins by checking if the medium is idle using a simulated random choice.
- If the medium is busy, the script waits for a randomly determined backoff time before attempting to transmit again.
- This process is repeated recursively until the medium is found to be idle, and the data transmission is simulated.

## Purpose

It aims to help beginners understand the basic principles behind the CSMA/CA protocol, which is crucial for managing access to shared transmission media in wireless networks.

## Disclaimer

This is a simplified simulation and does not represent the full complexity of real-world CSMA/CA implementations. It is not intended for use in actual network communications but as a learning tool.
